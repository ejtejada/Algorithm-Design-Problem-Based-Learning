# Algorithm-Design-Problem-Based-Learning
This book is for students who learn through problem solving or instructions as opposed to lectures and theory.
Most algorithm teach through direct presentation of facts and concepts, 
this books starts with the problem and proceeds to introduces the necessary ideas required to the problem therefore giving students 
the opportunity to formulate a solution . The stages are as follows: present the problem, gather resources (information gathering), 
formulate a solution. Students consider the problem and solve it using the information provided. 
"If a student is tasked with cooking an cake he is given the ingredients and tools and from this they formulate a solution" . 
[Read Problem ] -> [Facts and Concepts] -> [ Formulate Solution] -> [Solution]
