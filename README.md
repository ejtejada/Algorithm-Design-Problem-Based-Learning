# Algorithm-Design-Problem-Based-Learning

This book is for students who wish to learn Algorithm Design & Analysis through a much more practical approach of problem solving as opposed to simply lectures and theory.

While most algorithm textbooks and courses are taught through the  presentation of facts and concepts, this publications seeks to provide the students the opportunity to gain a more fundamental approach to algorithm design by provided students problems of increasing difficulty while imparting the necessary ideas to formulate a solution.

Lessons are formulated under the following strategy: present the problem, gather resources (information gathering), 
formulate a solution. Students consider the problem and solve it using the information provided. 

A simple example using the above concepts:
"If a student is tasked with cooking an cake he is given the ingredients and tools and from this they formulate a solution" . 
[Read Problem ] -> [Facts and Concepts] -> [ Formulate Solution] -> [Solution]
